Version 0.2.0 (2012-09-21)
==========================

The v0.2.0 release marks the first step towards a redesign of the public
interface. The major highlights of this release are the introduction of
a namespace prefix, the device enumeration support, and a much more
flexible logging system.

Please note that the public interface has changed significantly, and
therefore this release is NOT backwards compatible with the previous
release. Applications will have to be updated to support the new
features!

 * Add support for the Heinrichs Weikamp Frog.
 * Separate private and public headers.
