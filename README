For the main plugin :

- in a shell, place yourself in the same folder as this readme
- launch the correct prep... command for your platform with the arguments "projects" and "build" :
	./firebreath/prepmac.sh projects build
	firebreath\prep2010.cmd projects build

- open the project generated in the new "build" directory :
	FireBreath.xcode
	FireBreath.sln


- In order to compile libdivecomputer
	include all .C and .H files in the project, except irda.cpp


On windows, the easiest way is to register the dll in build/bin/DiveBoard/Debug
	regsvr32 npPluginTemplate.dll



Good luck !
