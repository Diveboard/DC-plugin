1/ Build the main plugin :

- in a shell, place yourself in the same folder as this readme
- launch the correct prep... command for your platform with the arguments "projects" and "build" :
	./firebreath/prepmac.sh projects build
	firebreath\prep2010.cmd projects build

- open the project generated in the new "build" directory :
	FireBreath.xcode
	FireBreath.sln

Note for Mac build: in case of error with lipo, it might be because of parallel build. To disactivate that feature in xcode, go to "Project/Edit Project settings" and uncheck "Build independant targets in parallel"



2/ Build the library libdivecomputer :

- Open the project file
	Mac : libdivecomputer/libdivecomputer.xcodeproj
	Windows : libdivecomputer/libdivecomputer.sdf


- The built library will be :
	Mac : libdivecomputer/build/Debug/liblibdivecomputer.dylib 
	Windows : 

3/ Build the package

- To build the package run
	Mac : mkpkg4mac.sh
	Windows : compile with NSIS (Nullsoft Installer) projects\diveboard\installer.nsi

- The installation package will be placed in
	Mac : build/packages/diveboard.dmg
	Windows : build\bin\DiveBoard\Debug\DiveBoard-debug.exe



Notes : 

On windows, the easiest way is to register the dll in build/bin/DiveBoard/Debug
	regsvr32 npPluginTemplate.dll





Good luck !
